# Fancy macro for Chromatic Orb

This is a basic Item Macro that will take the damage you've selected when you cast the spell and change the color of the effect based on that damage. Remove all damage from the spell details tab. This macro handles it all. (I've included a downloadable .json if you'd just like to import this and run.)

## Necessary Modules

- Item Macro
- Midi-Qol
- JB2A Patreon (you can set up your own special effects with some tinkering)
- Sequencer
- WarpGate (for the menu)

## Kudos

As usual, Honeybadger, Freeze and Wasp were immensely helpful on the Foundry discord. They are heroes.
