# Fancy macro for Chromatic Orb

This is a basic Item Macro that will take the damage you've selected when you cast the spell and change the color of the effect based on that damage.

## Necessary Modules

- Item Macro
- Midi-Qol
- JB2A Patreon (you can set up your own special effects with some tinkering)
- Sequencer
- WarpGate (for the menu)

## Kudos

As usual, Honeybadger, Freeze and Wasp were immensely helpful on the Foundry discor. They are heroes.
